# Druid Plumbers
The Plumber handles generated segments both while they are being generated and when they are "done". This is also technically a pluggable interface and there are multiple implementations. However, plumbers handle numerous complex details, and therefore an advanced understanding of Druid is recommended before implementing your own. 

|Field|Type|Description|Required|
|-----|----|-----------|--------|
|type|String|Specifies the type of plumber. Each value will have its own configuration schema, plumbers packaged with Druid are described below.|yes|

The following can be configured on the plumber:

*   `windowPeriod` is the amount of lag time to allow events. This is configured with a 10 minute window, meaning that any event more than 10 minutes ago will be thrown away and not included in the segment generated by the realtime server.
*   `basePersistDirectory` is the directory to put things that need persistence. The plumber is responsible for the actual intermediate persists and this tells it where to store those persists.
*   `maxPendingPersists` is how many persists a plumber can do concurrently without starting to block.
